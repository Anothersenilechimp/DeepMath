A Game for building AN INTUITIVE UNDERSTANDING OF VARIABLES

With this part of the project I want to grow in the minds of people/students an intuitive understanding of what variables are.

This is some of my random flow of consciousness a.k.a brainstorming.

Variables are symbols, they can be pictures, letters, icons, even logos.
Variables are a piece of a machine called Functions and they stand in place of other quantities of things (this is my overly plain english way of saying variables are 
representations). Variables can be placeholders for quantities, magnitudes, sizes, amounts, like speed, distance, temperature, etc

A story of variables
I want to use a story to convey this understanding of variables. 
In this story Characters are making calculations. The calculations are consequential to the story.

I think it should be a velocity calculation.

The Story
Survivors of a post apocalyptic civilisation have a vehicle that can only travel at a certain high velocity. 
These survivors have to perfectly time (through calculations), the window of time when they can discharge of cargo being shipped to and from locations.
All they have is a button that temporarily slows the vehicle down, which gives them this window of opportunity.

More than anything this project DeepMath is about growing an intuitive understanding of all of Mathematics. This can be done through gaming that is narrative driven.
The narrative allows for a fuller learning experience that can convey, virtually, the physical manifestation of the abstractions of Mathematics, which allows the 
intuitions to be grown.
DeepMath should also be in the spirit of 4e Cognition and use the story style of learning to convey characters that are embedded in a world and a condition,
who embody certain mathematical abstractions and methods, who enact the ideas they have (practical knowledge), and extend their own cognitive abilities through their
willingness to depend on each other.

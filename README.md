This is the first step towards building better educational systems using computation. I hope that this project will make us think about how boring school made learning and how exciting computation could make it. Please offer any help and or guidance. Your consideration is appreciated. Thank you.

This is a python program that simulates a simple high school linear equation in algebra. 
You have 4 variables you can choose from. 
Each gives you a question that asks you to solve the equation for the variable you chose. 
All other variables are randomly generated. 
You also get feedback telling you whether or not you got the right answer. 
Your answer should be rounded off to two decimal places.
